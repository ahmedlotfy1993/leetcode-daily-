/*
Problem:
--------
You're visiting a farm with fruit trees planted in a row, represented by an integer array `fruits`,
where `fruits[i]` is the type of fruit on the i-th tree.

Rules for collecting fruit:
- You have two baskets, and each can only hold one type of fruit.
- Starting from any tree, you must pick exactly one fruit from each tree while moving to the right.
- You must stop picking once you encounter a third fruit type that doesn't fit in either basket.

Goal:
-----
Return the maximum number of fruits you can collect under the above constraints.
*/

/*
 Approach:
---------
Manual Map Management:
   ----------------------------------------------
   - Iterate through the array and track fruit types manually in a map.
   - When a third fruit type is encountered, compute the result so far.
   - Backtrack to find the last contiguous group of the previous fruit and retain that in the new window.
   - Clear and rebuild the map with the new window starting from that repeated fruit.
   - Continue iterating and updating the result.
   
   Pros:
   - More intuitive about how fruit types are grouped.
   - Helps understand how repeated fruits form the basis for new baskets.

   Cons:
   - More verbose and error-prone.
   - Less efficient compared to the sliding window method.

 Approach:
---------
Sliding Window Approach :
   -----------------------------------
   - Use a sliding window defined by two pointers: `left` and `right`.
   - Expand the window by moving `right` and keep track of fruit types using a hashmap `count`.
   - If more than 2 types are in the map, shrink the window from the `left` until only 2 remain.
   - Keep updating `max_len` with the size of the current valid window.
   
   Time Complexity: O(n)
   Space Complexity: O(1) â€” map will hold at most 3 keys (since we break on >2).
