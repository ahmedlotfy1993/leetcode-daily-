# 🧠 LeetCode Daily Challenge Solutions

Hi! 👋 I'm Ahmed and this is my collection of daily LeetCode problems solved in C++.

This repository helps me stay consistent with algorithm practice, sharpen my data structure skills, and keep track of my progress.

---

## 📅 Daily Commitment

I'm solving at least **one LeetCode problem per day** and pushing the solution here with:
- Clean and readable code
- Time and space complexity notes
- Organized folder structure

---

## 📁 Repository Organization

Each problem is saved based on the **year and month of solving**, and the file name includes:
- The date of submission
- A simplified version of the problem name

### Folder/File Naming Format:

- `<year>`: Year of solving the problem (e.g. `2025`)
- `<month>`: Month name with optional numbering (e.g. `08-Aug`)
- `<date>`: Full date of solving (e.g. `2025-08-09`)
- `<problem-title>`: Short, lowercase version of the problem name with dashes
- `<language_extension>`: File extension (`.cpp`)
